# Chook

A React website for recipes and general dinner planning. "Chook" is a combination of "chef" and "cook", and also happens to be a slang term for chicken.
Considering the double O's, the name has a chance of becoming a famous internet company, according to Gwyneth Paltrow; "successful internet companies have double O's in their name".

## My Thoughts

Having an interest for cooking and programming, a project like this was inevitable. The problem, however, was figuring out what to make, how to make it, when to make it, and where to do it. The conclusion was first an app, then a webpage, then an API, then a helper webpage to upload data, then back to webpage. 

I think I've come to a final conclusion that a webpage is the superior option, and that I will first make a simple one with React, then add API functions as necessary.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
